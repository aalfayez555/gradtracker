Startup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To start the server and begin displaying data, run the bootstrapgetdata.js
file. The project is contained within one webpage, so there is no need to
navigate away from the index URL.

Searching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The search bar is currently configured to search the entire document set for
anything that matches the query.

Sorting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Search results can be sorted by clicking the arrows next to each of the
column headers. Results can be sorted in descending or ascending order. The
number of entries shown per page can be configured on the top left side of the
results table.

Inserting Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Data can be inserted into the database by clicking the 'create' button at
the top right of the results table. This will bring up a form in which values 
can be specified for the new entry. When all of the desired values have been
entered, the 'submit' button will insert the data into the database.

Note that not all of the forms need to be filled out when creating a new
database entry.

Editing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To edit the data within the database, click the edit button at the top right
of the results table. This will bring up a popup window in which data can be
edited. To save the changes, click the save changes button -- otherwise, click
close or the 'x' button.
